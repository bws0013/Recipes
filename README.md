# Recipes

### Explanation

I use github for all of my coding stuff, it just feels like a natural extension to also host recipes of food I make here too. Okay, maybe not a natural extension, but I think version control would be an awesome thing for me to be able to look through my cooking history, which at this point, isn't far.
