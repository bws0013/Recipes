The Inspiration for this was from a Reverse Sear Steak recipe from a [tasty video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnuFrNjAgyM).

Ingredients:

- Half of a 12 ounce new york strip steak
- 1 cup of Basmati/Texmati rice
- 1 Tablespoon of olive oil
- 3 Tablespoons of canola oil
- 2 Tablespoons of butter
- Cilantro to Taste for rice
- Salt
- Pepper
- A single bayleaf
- Rice
- Lemon Juice (from a plastic lemon)
- Lime Juice (from a plastic lime)
- Orange Sweet Pepper

Technique:

* Placed 3 Tablespoons of canola oil in a little plastic cup
* 2 Tablespoons of butter in a little plastic cup
* Preheat oven to 200 degrees F
* Rice
  * Clean rice in sink
  * Add to rice cooker
  * Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil
  * Add a nickel/quarter size bit of salt
  * Add bayleaf
  * Add water up to the line
  * Start rice cooker
  * Once rice cooker is done, give it 5 more minutes on the cooker
  * Remove from cooker for 5 minutes
  * Open lid and remove bay leaf
  * Add cilantro, lemon juice and lime juice to taste

* Steak
  * Moved steak from freezer to fridge at least 24 hours before it was to be cooked.
  * Salt and peppered steak and let it sit outside of the fridge for approximately 40 minutes to warm up
  * Put into oven for around 40 minutes
  * Heated up cast iron on high (started stove when there was approx. 5 minutes left on steak in the over)
  * Removed Steak from oven
  * Added oil to pan
  * **Things go off the rails**

### Off the rails
  The second I put the 3 Tablespoons of canola oil in the pan, the caste iron started smoking a ton, it looked like a it was about to ignite so I quickly removed it from the heat and placed it onto an unused burner. I then spent the next 10-15 minutes with my fan on and my door and window open clearing out smoke.
